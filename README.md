# Intro
Application Security Training Playbook is part of the IBM AppSec Champion Service. It describes the main steps for fast establishment of a Security Champions program regardless of the company size and maturity of the existing security processes.


# Who should take part of the Application Security Training?
According to OWASP definition, Security Champions are "active members of a team that may help to make decisions about when to engage the Security Team". They act as a core element of security assurance process within the product or service, and hold the role of the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) within the team.
